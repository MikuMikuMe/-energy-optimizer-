Below is a Python program for the **Energy-Optimizer** project. This program analyzes household energy consumption based on sample data and provides personalized recommendations to help users reduce electricity usage and costs. The program includes comments and basic error handling.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample data: daily energy consumption in kWh for a month
data = {
    'Day': np.arange(1, 31),
    'Energy_Consumption_kWh': np.random.uniform(10, 30, size=30)  # Random data for illustration
}

# Convert the data to a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Define a function to calculate average daily consumption
def calculate_average_consumption(df):
    try:
        average_consumption = df['Energy_Consumption_kWh'].mean()
        return average_consumption
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calculating average consumption: {e}")
        return None

# Function to generate recommendations based on consumption
def generate_recommendations(average_consumption, threshold=20):
    recommendations = []
    try:
        if average_consumption is not None:
            if average_consumption > threshold:
                recommendations.append("Consider using energy-efficient appliances.")
                recommendations.append("Turn off lights and appliances when not in use.")
                recommendations.append("Use programmable thermostats to optimize heating and cooling.")
            else:
                recommendations.append("Keep up the good work!")
                recommendations.append("Monitor and maintain current energy-saving habits.")
        else:
            print("Average consumption data is unavailable.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error generating recommendations: {e}")
    
    return recommendations

# Calculate the average daily energy consumption
avg_consumption = calculate_average_consumption(df)
print(f"Average Daily Energy Consumption: {avg_consumption:.2f} kWh")

# Get personalized recommendations based on the average consumption
recommendations = generate_recommendations(avg_consumption)

# Print the recommendations
print("\nPersonalized Energy Saving Recommendations:")
for i, rec in enumerate(recommendations, 1):
    print(f"{i}. {rec}")

# Main function to run the program
def main():
    try:
        avg_consumption = calculate_average_consumption(df)
        if avg_consumption is not None:
            print(f"Average Daily Energy Consumption: {avg_consumption:.2f} kWh")
            recommendations = generate_recommendations(avg_consumption)
            print("\nPersonalized Energy Saving Recommendations:")
            for i, rec in enumerate(recommendations, 1):
                print(f"{i}. {rec}")
        else:
            print("Unable to calculate average energy consumption.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred in the main function: {e}")

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Points:

1. **Simulated Data**: The program uses simulated daily energy consumption data for one month.

2. **Data Analysis**: 
   - Computes the average daily energy consumption.
   - Provides recommendations based on whether the average consumption exceeds a specific threshold.

3. **Recommendations**: Offers basic energy-saving suggestions depending on the energy consumption level.

4. **Error Handling**: Includes basic try-except blocks to handle exceptions that may occur during calculations or data processing.

5. **Modular Design**: The main logic is encapsulated within functions, improving readability and maintainability. The main function allows for easy execution.

This program serves as a base, and you can extend it further by including real-world data or more sophisticated recommendation engines using machine learning or statistical analysis.
